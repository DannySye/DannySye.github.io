      <p class="lead-text animate__animated animate__fadeInUp"><em>Eiraka Ryaitu</em></p>
      <div class="content-container">
        <p class="drop-cap animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">Hon. Katusiime Annet Mugisha, the reigning Woman Member of Parliament for Bushenyi District, has rolled out her action plan or manifesto for the 2026-2031 term of office. She is among the people who have already expressed interest in contesting in the 2025-26 election and representing her constituency in the 12th Parliament in the 2026-2031 term of office.</p>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">Hon. Katusiime has served one term, and her footprint is so satisfying that she has the highest chances of retaining her seat. No serious candidate has stood tall to challenge her candidature, at least in the National Resistance Movement Party primaries, though we so far don’t know what will happen after the primary elections.</p>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">The holder of a Master of Business Administration, a Bachelor of Social Development and Counselling, a diploma in primary education, and a grade 3 teachers’ certificate has been on a mission to enable development, unity and well-being for all people of Bushenyi District as part of Uganda. Her footprint is traced in 2017 when she embarked on community-based projects supporting the people of Bushenyi District to live transformed lives, envisioning a united and prosperous Bushenyi District.</p>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">Improving Household Incomes and Food Security, Children Education, Spirituality Development, Health and Hygiene, Water, Environment, Electricity, Infrastructure Development and Maintenance have been guiding her BAMUGISHA community development agenda and will continue to be the pillars of economic development for the Bushenyi Woman Member of Parliament (2026-2031).</p>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">Hon. Katusiime’s plan of action for 2026-2031 is based on the need to learn lessons from past achievements, consolidate achievements, and use the experience gained to do more for the people of Bushenyi District, among others. Her plan is generally to follow up and monitor the implementation of the NRM Manifesto (2026-2031) in Bushenyi District and specific focus areas that include her personal efforts.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">PLAN OF ACTION 2026-2031</h2>
        <h3 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">HOUSEHOLD INCOME IMPROVEMENT</h3>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">Following up and monitoring Government Wealth Creation Programmes, Provision of a coffee bursary by distributing coffee seedlings to farmers, Provision of poultry bursaries by hatching and distributing chicks to interested farmers, focusing mainly on youths, and continuing to support village saving groups (VSGs).</p>
        <h3 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">HEALTH</h3>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">Following up and monitoring government health centres to ensure that they are well equipped and have essential medicines and medical personnel who are effective in their work, lobbying and following up upgrading of selected health centres in accordance with government policy, in conjunction with Bushenyi district local government, working with the district leadership to focus on reduction of incidences of maternal and neonatal mortality deaths by lobbying for improved ambulance services, equipping maternal wards, sensitisation through radio programmes and improved antenatal services.</p>
        <h3 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">EDUCATION</h3>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">Here, the MP feels concerned about the issue of salary disparities among teachers. She will continue to advocate and dialogue for equitable salaries among teachers, improving the status of school infrastructure, scholastic materials, and adequacy of competent teachers in some parts of the district, which is currently not good. In conjunction with Bushenyi DLG, Hon. KAM will continue to lobby and advocate for a sufficient, decent, and enabling study environment for learners in schools, with adequate scholastic materials, good classrooms, and competent teachers.</p>
        <h3 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">WATER AND ELECTRICITY</h3>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">Knowing all the networks to work with to serve her people, Hon. KAM will continue working on increasing water and electricity coverage in the Bushenyi District. For electricity, she will follow up on sub-counties that are not served and are not yet mapped. At the same time, she will follow up on electricity extension to the sub-counties that are already mapped. For piped water, she will advocate for an additional water treatment plant for Bushenyi District. She will also advocate for the construction of a sewerage system for Bushenyi-Ishaka Municipality.</p>
        <h3 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE</h3>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">She will continue to advocate for the rehabilitation of Ishaka-Mbarara Road and the tarmacking of Nsiika-Nyakabirizi roads that are already under design/consideration by the government. In conjunction with the Bushenyi-Ishaka Municipal (BIM) Council, the woman MP will advocate for improved BIM roads through the USMID Project. Through the District Roads Committee, she promises to continue to ensure equitable improvement of road infrastructure in the district.</p>
        <h3 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">YOUTH EMPOWERMENT</h3>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">Hon. KAM will continue assisting the youths who have relevant academic qualifications to be treated fairly in accessing opportunities for formal employment but also continue to sensitise all youths on the opportunities that lie in self-employment. Where possible, she will advocate for competence-based training of youths to obtain relevant skills and also lobby for mindset change training for youth in different sub-counties.</p>
        <h3 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">FUNDRAISING SUPPORT AND DONATIONS</h3>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">Where possible, Hon. KAM will continue to support churches, mosques, schools, and community organisations in their action-orientated fundraising efforts as she has been doing.</p>
        <h3 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">LEGISLATION, OVERSIGHT AND APPROPRIATION</h3>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">As expected, the MP will play her primary roles, which derive, largely, from business presented by the executive in Parliament. She will also work to enhance her perfection in performing these roles by selecting committees of Parliament that largely incorporate her manifesto focus areas, strengthening comradeship and stakeholder networks, exploring benchmarking opportunities inside and outside Uganda and ensuring that the welfare of Ugandans is paramount.</p>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">This plan of action (manifesto) highlights what the woman MP did before she became District Woman Member of Parliament (2017-2021), during her term as MP (2021-2025), and the promises for 2026-2031.</p>
